why did you organize your code/classes/methods/functionality in this way?
   
   They were organized that was so it would be easy for anyone to understand what is happening, we tired to be as simple
   and descriptive. 



how did you learn about this [library/method/design pattern/technique]?

   I learned about it tru my teammates, for example Crystal explained to me how Bootstrap worked and Mattaus
    explained to us how he was able to have the image of the whiteboard and MD file created and saved. 

       

how did your team divide the work? which parts of the code are most familiar to you? (then, feel free to ask them lots 
of questions about the code that they worked on leastâ€“you should be able to explain every part of your app!)
    
    We divided the work amongst the areas that we were more conforatable and would be most productive. When we were
     finished with an aspect we would review with the team what we incorporated and how before our PR. 



which parts of your code feel hacky/buggy to you? can we try to work through those bugs now, live, together? 
(this will happen in almost every interview of this style!)

    There ware things that could use improvent like our form when rendered but we tried to stay away from hacky
     things to fix it.
